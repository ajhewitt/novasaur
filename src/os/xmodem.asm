;               CP/M XMODEM by Martin Eberhard 
;==============================================================
;A command line and/or configuration file-driven program for
;transferring files to and from a CP/M 1.4 or 2.2 system using
;the XMODEM protocol, supporting both the original XMODEM
;checksum protocol and the newer XMODEM-CRC protocol.
;
;This program has been tested at 115.2 K Baud, running on a
;4 MHz Z80 with 0-wait state memory, and performing direct I/O
;via a CCS 2719A serial board (which is based on the Z80-DART).
;Calculations show that a 2 MHz 8080 ought to be able to send
;and receive up to 76.8K baud (with for example a Cromemco
;TU-ART), so long as there are not too many wait states.
;
; To use XMODEM, type:
;   XMODEM <filename> {option list}
;
; A file name is madatory, and can be any legal CP/M file
; name. If you are receiving with XMODEM and the file already
; exists, then you will be asked if it should be overwritten.
; If you are sending, then the file must exist, obviously.
;
; XMODEM first looks for a file called XMODEM.CFG on CP/M's
; default drive. If found, then this file is parsed for
; options, the same as the command line. XMODEM.CFG is parsed
; first, so that options that are set on the command line will
; override those set in XMOODEM.CFG.
;
; XMODEM.CFG and the command line both support the following
; options (though some are less useful on the command line.)
;
;  /R Specifies Receive mode
;
;  /S Specifies Send mode
;
;     If neither /R nor /S is specified then you will be asked.
;
;  /C Selects checksum error checking when receiving;
;     otherwise receiving uses CRC error checking. When
;     sending, the error-checking mode is set by the receiver.
;
;  /E Specifies an enhanced RDR routine that returns with the
;     Z flag set if no character is waiting. Note that this
;     option does not actually select the RDR device as the
;     transfer port. (/X2 does.)
;
;  /In h0 h1 h2... (max h7) Defines assembly code for the
;      custom I/O port (used by the /X3 option), using Intel
;      8080 machine language.
;
;        n = 0 specifies initialization code, to be run when
;              command line and config file parsing are done.
;              All registers may be trashed. This is useful
;              for setting the baud rate, etc.
;
;        n = 1 installs a transmit byte routine.
;              on entry to this routine, the character to send
;              is in c. do not trash de or hl. Sample custom
;              transmit routine (for SOLOS):
;              48        mov   b,c    ;SOLOS wants chr in b
;              3e 01     mvi   a,1    ;serial pseudoport
;              cd 1c c0  call  AOUT   ;output character
;            Encode as follows:
;              /I1 48 3E 01 CD 1C C0
;
;        n = 2 installs a receive status subroutine, which
;              should return with the Z flag set if no
;              character is waiting. Do not trash any registers
;              except psw. Sample routine:
;              3e 01     mvi   a,1    ;serial pseudoport
;              cd 22 c0  call  AINP   ;input character,
;                                     ;Z set if none
;            Encode as follows:
;              /I2 3E 01 CD 22 C0
;
;        n = 3 installs a receive character routine, assuming a
;              character is waiting. Returns the character in
;              a. Trashes no registers except psw. If no
;              routine is required (e.g.  for SOLOS), then no
;              /I3 option is required.
;
;  /M Print message on console. This lets you tell the user
;     e.g. what port is set up for direct I/O in XMODEM.CFG
;
;  /O Specifies an output sequence for an I/O port, intended to
;     initialize the direct I/O port. The form of this
;     option is:
;       /O pp h1 h2 ... hn
;     where pp is the port address, and all the subsequent
;     bytes are sent to that port. You can have more than
;     one /O option, allowing you e.g. to initialize the
;     UART and also to set the baud rate.
;
;  /P Defines the direct I/O transfer port (used by the /X2
;     option). The form of this command is:
;       /P ss dd qq rr tt
;       where:
;          ss is the status port (for Rx and Tx)
;          dd is the data port (for both Rx and tx)
;          qq is 00 if the ready bits are true when low
;            and 01 if the ready bits are true when high
;          rr is the receive-ready bit mask
;          tt is the transmit-ready bit mask
;
;     XMODEM assumes that the receive port works like this:
;       RXWAIT: in       <status port>
;               ani      <Rx Mask>
;               jz/jnz   RXWAIT
;               nop
;               in       <data port>
;
;     ..and the transmit port works like this:
;               push     psw
;       TXWAIT: in       <status port>
;               ani      <Tx Mask>
;               jz/jnz   TXWAIT
;               pop      psw
;               out      <data port>
;
;     Any port that can work with these templates will work
;     with XMODEM's /X2 option.
;
;  All variables for the /O and /P commands are in hexidecimal,
;  and must be exactly two characters long. Legal characters
;  are: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F}
;
;  /Q Specifies quiet mode, preventing messages and pacifiers
;     from being printed on the console during transfer. This
;     is particularly useful if the port you are using is also
;     the port used for CP/M's console. Otherwise, a '+' will
;     be printed on CON for every succesful block, and a '-'
;     will be printed for every block retry.
;
;  /Xn Specifies the transfer port:
;      n=0 uses CP/M's CON device. Contrary to CP/M specs,
;          the CON input port must not strip parity.
;
;      n=1 uses CP/M'd RDR and PUN devices. Contrary to CP/M
;          specs, the RDR input port must not strip parity.
;          Also use /E if the RDR driver has been enhanced
;          to return with the Z flag set when no character is
;          waiting. (Otherwise, no timeout is possible when
;          waiting for a RDR character.)
;
;      n=2 uses direct I/O, which can be set up using the /P
;          option. If no /P option is entered, then /X2 will
;          select a MITS 88-SIO port.
;
;      n=3 uses custom-patched I/O routines, set with the
;          /I option. If no /I option is entered then
;          transfers with /X3 will just cause errors.
;
;  /Zn Specifies CPU speed in MHz - n is between 1 and 9.
;      The default is 2 MHz. This is used for timeouts while
;      sending or receiving. The default is 2 MHz for an 8080,
;      and 4 MHz for a Z80. (Xmodem can tell the difference.)
;
;   A semicolon begins a comment on a new line. All characters
;   from the ';' until the end of the line will be ignored.
;
; Here is a sample XMODEM.CFG file:
;
;    /MDirect I/O is configured for 88-2SIO port B
;    /P 12 13 01 01 02	;set up for an 88-2SIO Port B
;    /O 12 03 15	;8 bits, 1 stop, no parity
;    /X2		;use direct I/O
;
; You can usually abort a transfer with ^C on the console.
;
; The /P option modifies code in the direct I/O transmit and
; receive routines. This is because the 8080 has no command to
; IN or OUT to a port that is specified by a register value -
; so self-modifying code is the only way.
;
; Code that is only used during initialization is at the end,
; and gets overwritten by the block buffer. XMODEM uses all
; available RAM (past its 2K runtime code, up through CP/M's
; CCP) for buffering received and transmitted data, to speed up
; transfers by minimizing disk accesses. This allows XMODEM to
; run comfortably in (for example) a 16K-byte CP/M system
; (with 10K of user memory), and still have a decent 8K data
; buffer and reasonably robust options and messages.
;
; This program will display correctly on screens that are 16X64
; or larger.

;Revision History:
;
; 1.0x  06 APR 2013 through 27 SEP 2014 M. Eberhard
;  Command-line driven versions Based on XMODEM for CDOS
;  (Z-80), version 1.03 by M. Eberhard
;
; 2.0  1 OCT 2014   M. Eberhard
;  New major release:
;   + Supports a configuration file (XMODEM.CFG), with same
;     options as on the command line
;   + combine features of all 1.0x assembly options
;   + Define direct I/O port in XMODEM.CFG (or on command line)
;   + User-set CPU speed (/Z), overrides 8080/Z80 defaults
;   + Option to delete file on /R, if it already exists
;   + Include which port we are using in announcement prior to
;     Xmodem file transfer
;   + A few new timeouts, to prevent hanging in odd situations
;   + Several other minor enhancements
;
; 2.1  3 Oct 2014  M. Eberhard
;  Fix bug in reporting the source of an error
;  Speed up RDR/PUN
;  require CR after "Y" on overwrite question
;
; 2.2  7 Oct 2014  M. Eberhard
;  fix error-reporting bug, increase stack size for BDOS
;
; 2.3  9 Oct 2014 M. Eberhard
;  Eliminate intermediate data buffer. Support CP/M 1.4
;
; 2.4  4 August 2016  M. Eberhard
;  Fix bug in TXLOOP that would cause sending with checksums
;  to fail. Fix bug causing a spurious block after the 1st
;  buffer-full of received data. (Thanks to Bob Bell for
;  helping find and fix these bugs.) Add /I cmd, and add /X3
;  option for custom port routine patching. (This makes it
;  possible to call external I/O routines, such as SOLOS or
;  POLEX.) Also cleaned up comments.
;
; 2.5  9 May 2017  M. Eberhard
;  Clean up file name in FCB if a command option was crammed
;  against the file name (no spaces) on the command line.
;
; 2.6  10 September 2017
;  Significant speed up by using table-driven CRC algorithm.
;  Make the initialization code modify the jump addresses in
;  RXBYTE and TXBYTE based on the type of transfer port
;  selected, eliminated some subroutine calls, and a few other
;  speed optimizations. Ask user for direction if no /R or /S
;  was specified. Use all RAM (even more than 32K) for the
;  buffer. perform initial buffer fill on Sends (before
;  determining error checking mode), while the disk is still
;  spinning. Flush a byte from the receiver port at the
;  beginning, if possible. Squeeze a bit to keep disk file
;  smaller than 4K-bytes. Tidy up comments and labels.
;
; 2.7 9 October 2017  M. Eberhard
;  Fix stack bug when switching stacks
;
;To Do (maybe in some future version):
;  Support Y-Modem (file name in block 0, 1K blocks, etc.)
;  Terminal mode for port testing/modem setup
;  Support for S-100 internal modem
; (If any of these would be useful to you, let me know...)
